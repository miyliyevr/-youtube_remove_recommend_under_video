# youtube_remove_recommend_under_video

This is Tampermonkey script which removes the newly introduced reccomendations of Youtube just below the Yotube video player.
Tampermonkey is a chrome extention that allows to run a javascript on a webpage.
Youtube on 8.04.2024, videos recommendations that previously were on Youtube main page, introduced now under the video player. This is very uncomfortabel, the comments section is moved to the right to the very narrow column.

This script is removing/hiding the video recommendation section and expands comments section, as it was before.
